PiFM GTK 1.2.1
=========


## What is PiFM?
This first sections covers the need for PiFM GTK and why it was created. If you are only looking for the installation, skip ahead to the [setup](#Prepping-the-Pi).

PiFM GTK is an extension to the already popular [PiFmAdv](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwio9Zml3rPpAhWMT8AKHY3pB3YQFjAAegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmiegl%2FPiFmAdv&usg=AOvVaw0yjOcSmzqDT7XF36NZs7zl) repository developd by Miegl. This extension features a small number of additional files that greatly assist the procedure to install and set up the software. The main focus of PiFM GTK is to allow anybody from a complete Linux or radio novice to a command-line expert or radiohead find an affordable substitute to a significantly more expensive FM transmitter which can cost thousands of times more than the Raspberry Pi. This is all controlled through an intuitive graphical interface based on the modern GTK library and means you don't have to struggle with an (for new users especially) intimidating command-line.

## Compatibility
This piece of software is designed to work will all versions of the Raspberry Pi including the Raspberry Pi 4b! The installation is designed to be done on Raspberry Pi OS, which is the Official Raspberry Pi Operating System. It is guaranteed to work on any version from August 2015 and later, as the installer is automatically designed to check that all dependencies are present (previous versions do not have the `rpi-mailbox` driver), however it is recommended to use a fresh install to reduce the likelihood of any errors.

## How it Works
This program generates an FM modulation, with RDS (Radio Data System) data generated in real time as well as having the ability to use both monophonic and stereophonic audio.

PiFM modulates the PLLC instead of the clock divider for increased signal purity, meaning that the signal is also less noisy. This has a great impact on stereo, as it's reception is significantly better.

For the PLLC modulation to be stable there is an additional step. Due to the low-voltage detection, the PLLC frequency can be reduced to a safe value in an attempt to restrict crashes. When this happens, the carrier freqency changes based on the GPU frequency.
To prevent this, we can tweak the GPU freqency to match the safe frequency. Now when due the low voltage detection occurs, the PLLC frequency changes to safe value, meaning nothing happens since the normal value and safe value are identical.

This project is based on an earlier FM transmitter developed by [Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl](http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter), and later adapted to using DMA by [Richard Hirst](https://github.com/richardghirst). Christophe Jacquet manipulated it, adding the RDS data generator and modulator. The transmitter uses the Raspberry Pi's PWM generator to produce VHF signals.

## Prepping the Pi
**Required Equipment:**
* Raspberry Pi (1a, 1b, 1a+, 1b+, 2b, 3b, 3a+, 3b+, 4b, Zero, Zero W are all compatible)
* Acceptable power supply (recommended at least 2A)
* SD Card (4gb minimum with Raspberry Pi OS Desktop installed. See [installation guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/2))
* Mini HDMI cable (Pi Zero or Zero W)
* HDMI cable (Pi 1a, 1b, 1a+, 1b+, 2b, 3b, 3a+, 3b+, 4b)
* Ethernet cable (unless it has onboard WiFi or you have a WiFi dongle)
* USB keyboard/mouse
* HDMI monitor/tv to display the desktop

**Optional Equipment:**
* Portable display (to make it more compact and portable)
* Portable power bank (so that you can use it on the go)
* USB drive (to store your .wav and .ogg audio files)
* Piece of wire to act as an antenna (GPIO 4)

## Installation
PiFM 1.2.1 depends on a number of prerequisites. These are required. to get the transmitter ready.

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS Desktop onto an SD card (click [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/2) for a detailed guide) (This was built using Raspbian Stretch. See [here](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/) for archived images.)
2. Connect your peripherals to the Raspberry Pi (keyboard/mouse/SD/HDMI/etc...)
3. Once you are ready to start, turn on the Pi and wait until the desktop environment appears, before connecting to a network.
4. At the top left of the screen click the terminal icon and wait for the terminal window to load
5. Once it has loaded, type in the following commands.

**Pi 4 Installation**
```
sudo apt-get install git -y
```
This will install git, which allows you to download files from Github
```
git clone https://github.com/mundeepl/PiFM
```
This will download the software from this repository
```
chmod +x ~/PiFM/setup-pi4.sh
```
This changes the permissions to allow you to run the setup
```
./PiFM/setup-pi4.sh
```
**Previous Pi Versions**
```
sudo apt-get install git -y
```
This will install git, which allows you to download files from Github
```
git clone https://github.com/mundeepl/PiFM
```
This will download the software from this repository
```
chmod +x ~/PiFM/setup.sh
```
This changes the permissions to allow you to run the setup
```
./PiFM/setup.sh
```
This begins the installation script for the software and is a fully automated process, and very verbose, so you can see what is happening. Please note that your Raspberry Pi will automatically reboot after the installation is complete.

**Important.** The binaries compiled for each Raspberry Pi is different. Therefore, always re-compile when switching models. To do this, simply re-run the installers.

## Usage
* Find the PiFM shortcut in the applications menu in the 'other' submenu.
* Use the shortcut located on the desktop.
* Open a terminal window and type `pifm` and hit enter.
* For a terminal based, yet still simple method, type `pifm-basic` into a terminal and hit enter.
Once loaded, a pop-up will appear providing information about the software as well as the supported file types. After clicking Begin, you will be faced with a series of variables allowing you to change the properties of the FM-RDS transmission. After choosing the final option, the software will start.

Included are a number of sample audio files located in the `sounds` directory
* `noise_22050.wav` is static sound
* `pulses.wav` is a single pulse
* `sound.wav` is the file for testing signal quality vs. range
* `stereo_44100` allows you to try stereophonic audio

Also included is a dipole calculator allowing you to calculate your dipole antenna length. To use it, open a terminal and type:
```
python3 dipole
```

If at any point you wish to close the broadcast, make the terminal window active and press CTRL and C together to close the program.

## Advanced Users (those confident with a terminal)
You can also use PiFM using the terminal
```
cd ~/PiFM/src
sudo ./PiFM
```
This will generate an FM transmission on 87.6Mhz, with default station name (PS), radiotext (RT) and PI-code (PI), without audio. The radio frequency signal is emitted on GPIO 4 (pin 7 on header P1).
You can add monophonic or stereophonic audio by referencing an audio file as follows:
```
sudo ./PiFM --audio sound.wav
```
To test stereophonic audio, you can try the file `stereo_44100.wav` which has been provided.
```
sudo ./PiFM --audio stereo_44100.wav
```
## All Arguments are Optional:
* `--freq` specifies the carrier frequency (in MHz). Example: `--freq 87.6`.
* `--audio` specifies an audio file to play as audio. The sample rate does not matter: PiFmAdv will resample and filter it. If a stereo file is provided, PiFmAdv will produce an FM-Stereo signal. Example: `--audio sound.wav`. The supported formats depend on `libsndfile`. This includes WAV and Ogg/Vorbis (among others) but not MP3. Specify `-` as the file name to read audio data on standard input (useful for piping audio into PiFM, see below).
* `--pi` specifies the PI-code of the RDS broadcast. 4 hexadecimal digits. Example: `--pi FFFF`.
* `--ps` specifies the station name (Program Service name, PS) of the RDS broadcast. Limit: 8 characters. Example: `--ps RASP-PI`.
* `--rt` specifies the radiotext (RT) to be transmitted. Limit: 64 characters. Example:  `--rt 'Hello, world!'`.
* `--af` specifies alternative frequencies (AF). Example:  `--af 107.9 --af 99.2`.
* `--pty` specifies the program type. 0 - 31. Example: `--pty 10` (EU: Pop music). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System for more program types.
* `--tp` specifies if the program carries traffic information.  Example `--tp 0`.
* `--dev` specifies the frequency deviation (in KHz). Example `--dev 25.0`.
* `--mpx` specifies the output mpx power. Default 30. Example `--mpx 20`.
* `--power` specifies the drive strength of gpio pads. 0 = 2mA ... 7 = 16mA. Default 7. Example `--power 5`.
* `--gpio` specifies the GPIO pin used for transmitting. Available GPIO pins: 4, 20, 32, 34. Default 4. Example `--gpio 32`.
* `--cutoff` specifies the cutoff frequency (in Hz) used by PiFmAdv's internal lowpass filter. Values greater than 15000 are not compliant. Use carefully.
* `--preemph` specifies which preemph should be used, since it differs from location. For Europe choose 'eu', for the US choose 'us'.
* `--ctl` specifies a named pipe (FIFO) to use as a control channel to change PS and RT at run-time (see below).
* `--ppm` specifies your Raspberry Pi's oscillator error in parts per million (ppm), see below.
* `--rds` RDS broadcast switch.
* `--wait` specifies whether PiFmAdv should wait for the the audio pipe or terminate as soon as there is no audio. It's set to 1 by default. 

By default the PS changes back and forth between `PiFmAdv` and a sequence number, starting at `00000000`. The PS changes around one time per second.

## Clock Calibration (only if experiencing difficulties)
The RDS standards states that the error for the 57 kHz subcarrier must be less than ± 6 Hz, i.e. less than 105 ppm (parts per million). The Raspberry Pi's oscillator error may be above this figure. That is where the `--ppm` parameter comes into play: you specify your Pi's error and PiFmAdv adjusts the clock dividers accordingly.
In practice, I found that PiFmAdv works quite well even without using the `--ppm` parameter. This may be due to the majority of receivers being more tolerant than outlined in the RDS specification.

One way to measure the ppm error is to play the `pulses.wav` file: it will play a pulse for precisely 1 second, then play a 1-second silence, and so on. Record the audio output from a radio with a good audio card. Say you sample at 44.1 kHz. Measure 10 intervals. Using [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), for example, determine the number of samples of these 10 intervals: in the absence of clock error, it should be 441,000 samples. With my Pi, I found 441,132 samples. Therefore, the ppm error is (441132-441000)/441000 * 1e6 = 299 ppm, **assuming that the sampling device (audio card) has no clock error...**

## Piping Audio Into PiFM
If you use the argument `--audio -`, PiFM reads audio data on standard input. This allows you to pipe the output of a program into PiFM. For instance, this can be used to read MP3 files using Sox:
```
sox -t mp3 http://www.linuxvoice.com/episodes/lv_s02e01.mp3 -t wav -  | sudo ./PiFM --audio -
```
Or to pipe the AUX input of a sound card into PiFM...
```
sudo arecord -fS16_LE -r 44100 -Dplughw:1,0 -c 2 -  | sudo ./PiFM --audio -
```
## Changing PS, RT, TA and PTY at Run-Time
You can control PS, RT, TA (Traffic Announcement flag) and PTY (Program Type) at run-time using a named pipe (FIFO). For this, run PiFM with the `--ctl` argument.

Example:
```
mkfifo rds_ctl
sudo ./PiFM --ctl rds_ctl
```
Then you can send “commands” to change PS, RT, TA and PTY:
```
cat >rds_ctl
PS MyText
RT A text to be sent as radiotext
PTY 10
TA ON
PS OtherTxt
TA OFF
...
```
Every line must start with either `PS`, `RT`, `TA` or `PTY`, followed by one space character, and the desired value. Any other line format is silently ignored. `TA ON` switches the Traffic Announcement flag to *on*, any other value switches it to *off*.

## Warning and Disclaimer
PiFM is an **very experimental** program, designed **only for experimentation**. It is in no way intended to become a personal *media center* or a tool to operate a *radio station*, or even broadcast sound to one's own stereo system.

In most countries, transmitting radio waves without a state-issued licence specific to the transmission modalities (frequency, power, bandwidth, etc.) is **illegal**.

Therefore, always connect a shielded transmission line from the Raspberry Pi directly
to a radio receiver, so as **not** to emit radio waves. Never use an antenna.

Even if you are a licensed amateur radio operator, using PiFM to transmit radio waves on ham frequencies without any filtering between the Raspberry Pi and an antenna is most most likely illegal since the square-wave carrier is very rich in harmonics, so the bandwidth requirements are likely not met.

I can not be held liable for any misuse of your own Raspberry Pi. Any experimentation is done under your own responsibility.

## Tests
PiFM was successfully tested with the following RDS-able devices, namely:
* a Roberts Play DAB/DAB+/FM RDS Digital Radio from 2015
* a Sony ICF-C20RDS alarm clock from 1995,
* a Sangean PR-D1 portable receiver from 1998, and an ATS-305 from 1999,
* a Samsung Galaxy S2 mobile phone from 2011,
* a Philips MBD7020 hifi system from 2012,
* a Silicon Labs [USBFMRADIO-RD](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBFMRadioRD.aspx) USB stick, employing an Si4701 chip, and using my [RDS Surveyor](http://rds-surveyor.sourceforge.net/) program,
* a “PCear FM Radio”, a Chinese clone of the above, again, using RDS Surveyor.

Reception works perfectly with all the devices above and RDS Surveyor reports no group errors.

## CPU Usage
CPU usage is as follows:
* Without audio: 9%
* With mono audio: 33%
* With stereo audio: 40%

CPU usage increases dramatically when adding audio because the program has to upsample the (unspecified) sample rate of the input audio file to 228 kHz, its internal operating sample rate. Doing so, it has to apply an FIR filter, which is fairly CPU intensive.

## Design
The RDS data generator lies in the `rds.c` file.

The RDS data generator generates cyclically four 0A groups (for transmitting PS), and one 2A group (for transmitting RT). In addition, every minute, it inserts a 4A group (for transmitting CT, clock time). `get_rds_group` generates one group, and uses `crc` for computing the CRC.

To get samples of RDS data, call `get_rds_samples`. It calls `get_rds_group`, differentially encodes the signal and generates a shaped biphase symbol. Successive biphase symbols overlap: the samples are added so that the result is equivalent to applying the shaping filter (a [root-raised-cosine (RRC) filter ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-raised-cosine_filter) specified in the RDS standard) to a sequence of Manchester-encoded pulses.

The shaped biphase symbol is generated once and for all by a Python program called `generate_waveforms.py` that uses [Pydemod](https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/Pydemod), another software radio project. This Python program generates an array called `waveform_biphase` that results from the application of the RRC filter to a positive-negative impulse pair. *Note that the output of `generate_waveforms.py`, two files named `waveforms.c` and `waveforms.h`, are included in the Git repository, so you don't need to run the Python script yourself to compile PiFM.*

Internally, the program samples all signals at 228 kHz, four times the RDS subcarrier's 57 kHz.

The FM multiplex signal (baseband signal) is generated by `fm_mpx.c`. This file handles the upsampling of the input audio file to 228 kHz, and the generation of the multiplex: unmodulated left+right signal (limited to 15 kHz), possibly the stereo pilot at 19 kHz, possibly the left-right signal, amplitude-modulated on 38 kHz (suppressed carrier) and RDS signal from `rds.c`. Upsampling is performed using a zero-order hold followed by an FIR low-pass filter of order 60. The filter is a sampled sinc windowed by a Hamming window. The filter coefficients are generated at startup so that the filter cuts frequencies above the minimum of:
* the Nyquist frequency of the input audio file (half the sample rate) to avoid aliasing,
* 15 kHz, the bandpass of the left+right and left-right channels, as per the FM broadcasting standards.

The samples are played by `pi_fm_adv.c` that is adapted from Richard Hirst's [PiFmDma](https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/PiFmDma). The program was changed to support a sample rate of precisely 228 kHz.
